# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The main aim of the project is to build a fraud detection method. This problem includes modeling past transactions to detect fraud and then recognize whether the new data is fraud or normal. The focus is on resampling the model, build classification models and develop different anomaly detection algorithms to capture those fraud transactions correctly.
